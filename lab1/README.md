# Lab 1

#### Greedy heuristics

Implement three methods:
* Random solution
* Nearest neighbor
* Greedy cycle

adapted to our problem.

For each greedy method generate 200 solutions starting from each node. Generate also 200 random
solutions.

### Compilation instructions

Open terminal in `evo_comp` directory and run:
```bash
g++ src/*.cpp lab1/main.cpp -Isrc -o lab1/myprogram -std=c++20 && ./lab1/myprogram

```
