# Lab 1

#### Greedy heuristics

Implement three methods:
* Random solution
* Nearest neighbor
* Greedy cycle

adapted to our problem.

For each greedy method generate 200 solutions starting from each node. Generate also 200 random
solutions.

### Compilation instructions

Open terminal in the /src directory and run the command:
```
g++ *.cpp --std=c++17 -o my_program
```

In order to run the file:
```
./my_program
```

g++ src/*.cpp lab1/main.cpp -Isrc -o lab1/myprogram -std=c++17
