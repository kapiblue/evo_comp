### Global convexity (fitness-distance/similarity correlations) tests

For each instance generate 1000 random local optima obtained from random solutions using greedy
local search. For each solution calculate its similarity to the best solution (could the best out of the
1000 local optima or an even better solution generated by another method) and average similarity to
all other local optima. Make charts, x-axis â€“ value of the objective function, y-axis (average)
similarity.

Use (separately) two measures of similarity:
- The number of common edges.
- The number of common selected nodes.

Finally we have 8 charts: 2 instances, 2 versions of similarity (to the best or average), 2 similarity
measures.
For each chart calculate also the correlation coefficient.

In dir "evo_comp" execute:

```bash
g++ src/*.cpp lab8/main.cpp -Isrc -o lab8/myprogram -std=c++20 && ./lab8/myprogram
```
